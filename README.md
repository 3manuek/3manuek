## _"Biograffiti"_

My name is Emanuel, commonly named _Tresma_ -- the Spanish short of _3manuek_, my native language. I am a Software Engineer from Argentina, currently living in Madrid. More information about my profile can be found at my [personal website](https://tr3s.ma).

I am a highly experienced Database Engineer and Consultant, currently working at [Workato](https://workato.com).

I have been involved in the design and development of highly-concurrent, available, and transactional systems. Also participated in several Open Source projects, not exclusively related to the database field. I have also provided consulting services to Software Teams dealing with complex storage-layer refactors, for analytics, transactional, and search efficiency.
