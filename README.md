My name is _Emanuel_, commonly named _Tresma_ -- the Spanish short of _3manuek_, my native language. I am a Database and Infrastructure Engineer from Argentina, currently living in Spain, Madrid. More information about my profile can be found at my [personal website](https://tr3s.ma).

I am a highly experienced Database Engineer and Consultant, currently working at [Workato](https://workato.com) as a _Staff Infrastructure Engineer_ in the Data Storage Team.

I've been involved in the design and development of highly-concurrent, available, and transactional systems. Also participated in several Open Source projects, not exclusively related to the database field. I've also provided consulting services to Software Teams dealing with complex storage-layer refactors, for analytics, transactional, integration, and search efficiency.
