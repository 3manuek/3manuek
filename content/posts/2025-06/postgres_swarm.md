## Terminology 

In the case you're not familiar with the Docker terminology, here it is a brief description:

- [Stack](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/stack-deploy/): A collection of services that make up an application in a swarm.
- [Service](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/how-swarm-mode-works/services/): An application that runs on a swarm.
- [Container](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/how-swarm-mode-works/services/#images-and-containers): A process that runs on a node in a swarm.
- [Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/how-swarm-mode-works/nodes/): A cluster of Docker Engines that are joined together to run services.
