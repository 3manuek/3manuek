## Introduction

Some time ago I wrote a laboratory to evaluate PGCat's sharding feature. You can find it [here](https://github.com/3manuek/lab_pgcat).

However, I've been told to try PgDog's, as it had several features on top of PgCat. Plus, this project was created by the same author as PgCat.

I must say, I was impressed by the amount of features that PgDog offers, which are pretty much advanced compared to other 
middlewares out there for Postgres. A list of features can be found [here](https://docs.pgdog.dev/features/).
