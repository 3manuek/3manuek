## Bio(graffiti) 

I am a multifaceted professional with excellent communication skills, a
strong commitment to principles, and a passion for sharing knowledge and
code with others. 

Currently, I am the _Professional Services Technical Lead and Database
Platform and Systems Engineering_ at [OnGres](https://ongres.com), where I am
a valued partner, helping customers to design and operate highly
available and scalable databases.

In addition, I was the founder of [ViaDB](https://viadb.ar), specialized in
consultancy and tool development, using a variety of programming
languages including Go, Python, and Bash. The shop has closed operations in 2023.

Commitment to my principles and values drives my work, and I collaborate
with non-profit organizations such as [Apolo Foundation](https://fundacionapolo.org) and 
[Oportunidades Foundation](https://oportunidades.org.ar) to develop and support their IT ecosystems.

Before transitioning to a career in IT, between 1998 and 2007, I served
in the Argentina's Federal Bureau of Prisons (Servicio Penitenciario
Federal) as an officer, managing operational groups at institutions
ranging from medium to high security. For more details, see at the bottom
of this page.
