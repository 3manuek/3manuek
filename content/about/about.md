Hail, noble traveler! I be known as _3manuek_, though in the realms of the IT folk, they name me _Tresma_. I hail from the far-off lands of Argentina 🇦🇷 and now dwell within the fair borders of Spain 🇪🇸.

Aye, I have walked the path of an IT professional since the year of our Lord MMVI ([Résumé](/resume/)), and afore that, I toiled in the field of security.

Upon this site, thou shalt find snippets of mine work, writings, and sundry other matters.

Much more shall grace this page anon!

[Oportunidades Foundation](https://oportunidades.org.ar) among others to develop and support 
their IT ecosystems._

I practice [Radical Candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/), and I’m just as much a fan of Colemak.
