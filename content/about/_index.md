## Introduction

My name is Emanuel, commonly named Tresma -- as Spanish shortener of 3manuek, my native language. Located in Madrid, formerly in Buenos Aires.

I'm a DataBase Reliability Engineer (DBRE) and large-scale DevOps Engineer, and Consultant. Currently working at OnGres, Founder of ViaDB, and Fundación Apolo IT Director.

Profiles: [GitHub](https://github.com/3manuek) and [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/3manuek).


## Skillset

- A considerable experience around large scaled Database systems, including but not limited to Postgres, MySQL, ClickHouse, and Elastic. Most of the systems are/were business-critical. Knowledge on Scalability, Reliability, and Performance.
- Deploy and Infrastructure: Terraform/Packer, Ansible, Kubernetes, bare metal, etc.
- Consistent experience in almost every mayor Cloud provider. Azure certified, GCloud, and AWS.
- A skilled communicator, managing Customer accounts worlwide.
- Hard-problem solving, and with aveced dealing of complex Production incidents.


I design reliable, scalable and ready-for-production Database infrastructures for some _top-noch_ companies, based on Open Source Technologies from the ground up. That is, from coding the provisioning and deploy, components integrated in a Continuous Deployment (with Canary support, eg), to highly tweaked environments for performance and complex setups.

Other things that I love to do:

- I'm an experienced hydroponics _micro-grower_; DWC and NFT are my favorites and I do have both implemented.
- I'm an amateur musician, the typical string set plus some keyboards. Drawing is also a hobby.
- Love reading, particularly around polithical, econocomics and social affairs. An active Libertarian working from his basement :)

> As a previous and unrelated experience to IT, I worked as Officer and had quit as Adjutor Principal after 8 years of serving at Argentina's Federal Bureau of Prisons (Servicio Penitenciario Federal). I had been in charge of assigned groups at several institutions from medium to high security. I cooperated in the design of some of the security and emergency procedures and designed the operations and personnel capacitation. In the early days of my career, on the External Security Officer role, I managed the weapon capacity and storage of the shifts. I also conducted sanction procedures and crime investigations in several of those establishments. I must highlight that it is not possible to go any further whether you want to change things for good; there will be always someone on top of you trying to keep his/her power. And that was one of the reasons why I quit.
