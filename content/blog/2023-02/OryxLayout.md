# My Personal Ergodox Layout for Colemak and Dvorak

A few months ago, I bought the Ergodox OrthoLinear Split Keyboard. I found QWERTY layout a little uncomfortable to type in this keyboard, so I started the journey on searching for a better suitable keyboard layout. During a period of time, I switched back and forth between these three layouts, although I picked Colemak at the end.

I really like Dvorak, but I've found that Colemak was better for me as I also use DAWs with a lot of shortcuts and other MacOs utilities.

This is my current [MacOS Layout](https://configure.zsa.io/ergodox-ez/layouts/GLL7M/latest/0).
