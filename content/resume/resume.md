## Bio(graffiti) 
I'm a _Database Infrastructure and Software Engineer_, with a passion for Open Source technologies, and a strong focus in _scalability_, _reliability_, and _performance_.

Currently, I'm working at [Workato](https://workato.com) as a Staff Infrastructure Engineer in the Data Stores team, where I'm responsible for designing and implementing Database Infrastructures and Systems' Engineering.

My tasks involve Development, Deployment, Provisioning, CD/CI, and 2nd Day Operations to scalability, and performance. I also have a strong focus on Software Engineering, _mainly_ for database systems.

Open Source is a key part of my work, and I'm an active contributor to several projects, such as [Babelfish for Postgres](https://github.com/babelfish-for-postgres), 
[Earthly](https://earthly.io), among others. Check [toolbox](/toolbox) for some of my contributions.

I'm also a speaker at conferences and meetups, where I share my knowledge and experiences in the field of Database and Systems Engineering. You can find some of my talks at my [slides](https://github.com/3manuek/slides) repository.

I was born in üá¶üá∑, and I'm currently living in üá™üá∏.
