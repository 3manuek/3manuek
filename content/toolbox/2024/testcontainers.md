Testcontainers allows you to test your code with _ephemeral containers_ right inside your tests. 
It provides different modules for simplifying the process, however, sometimes you many need 
to customize the container beyond the default parameters or it contents.


This laboratory is an exploratory approach for setting tests that require Postgres services of different kinds.
