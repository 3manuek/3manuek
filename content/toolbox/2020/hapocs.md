As part of several lectured trainings and conference talks, I created this Docker Compose based laboratories to explore the HA implementations of the most popular Open Source Database engines, such as Postgres, MySQL, among others.

The picked technologies to do so, aren't conventional solutions, as the objective was to show Modern HA, using consensus for configuration consistency.

More up-to-date version of this, can be found between at **OnGres Labs**, as part of the material for its trainings.
