### Description

> Source Code: [iif Postgres Extension](https://gitlab.com/ongresinc/extensions/iif)


The [iif function](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/logical-functions-iif-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16) is a SQL Server function that returns one of two values based in a conditional boolean expression.

The core of the extension was developed time ago, and was converted into a extension as a 
training material.
